Do I need to install any of this?
=================================
Yes, if any of the following:

- You need library support for:
    - `CANcoder`_
    - `CANdle`_
    - `CANifier`_
    - `CANivore USB-to-CAN Adapter`_
    - `Falcon 500 Powered by Talon FX`_
    - `Pigeon IMU`_
    - `Pigeon 2.0`_
    - `Talon SRX`_
    - `Victor SPX`_
  
- You need to field upgrade `PCM`_, `PDP`_, or any of the above devices
- You want to use Phoenix Tuner for CAN diagnostics (highly recommended)

.. note:: `PCM`_ and `PDP`_ objects are already supported in the base FRC installation. However, Phoenix Tuner is required for setting the device ID, field-upgrade, and Self-test Snapshot.
