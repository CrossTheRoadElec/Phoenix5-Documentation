If seeking help troubleshooting hardware issues, please answer the questions under "Warranty" inside the "Support Request form".


To resolve your issue in an expedient fashion, we need the following:

- What behavior are you seeing versus what are you expecting to observe?
- What procedure are you following to reproduce the issue?
- If using the roboRIO, we need a screenshot of the Phoenix Tuner to confirm firmware version, gain values, etc.
- If using the roboRIO, we need a screenshot of a Self-test Snapshot taken during the undesired behavior.
- Part numbers of all devices involved. For example, if using a sensor, what is the sensor part number?
- Firmware versions of all devices involved.
- If using motor controllers, are they on CAN bus or PWM?
- If using Phoenix, screenshot of the About form in Phoenix Tuner / Phoenix LifeBoat.
